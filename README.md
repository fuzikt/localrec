# Localized Reconstruction

Localized reconstruction of flexible subunits from macromolecular complexes.

Version: 1.3.0

### New features added

RELION 3 compatible particle extraction.
NO Scipion needed to run!!!

--extract_from_micrographs  
Extract subparticles directly form micrographs instead from particle images. Cannot be used with signal subtraction.

--only_extract_unfinished  
Extract only particles not extracted in previous run.

--invert_contrast  
Use this option when extracting from micrographs that were not inverted (i.e. black particles ons on white background).

--normalize  
Normalize the extracted particles. Useful when extracting from micrographs.

--library_path  
define LD_LIBRARY_PATH used by Relion. Default: empty


### It also requires the following software:
* Relion 3
